# Airflow-Project
# üìö Amazon Books ETL with Airflow, Docker, and Postgres

This project is a beginner-friendly example demonstrating how to use **Apache Airflow** for building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. It fetches book data from Amazon (mocked/scraped), transforms it using Python, and stores the cleaned data into a **PostgreSQL** database ‚Äî all orchestrated using **Dockerized Airflow**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Apache Airflow** (2.9.2)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data cleaning

## Steps: 
## Initialize Airflow with docker compose up airflow-init:

## Once initialized the docker container will start running:

## Once done the Webserver shows the Dags and other operations involved in the Airflow. Can be accessed through the localhost:8080:

## This is the Pgadmin which can be accessed through localhost:5050

## Connection has to be made to connect the airflow with the database:
